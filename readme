I've lerant the lesson of last programming assignment, so I started early this time. It's a pretty good experience that we can put the GBN protocol in practice, in other words, this programming assignment gave me a chance to closely observe how these protocols we had learnt in class work. Besides, I also learnt that 1) I should follow the FSM given by our testbook, 2) the code style is quite important and 3) how to write an efficient c code with multithreading.

In addition, I also learnt how to change int or double variable into strings, which used to spend a lot of time and I had to debug for a long time since I met a lot of segment fault.

Here's my test, and the parameters are listed as follow:

Window size: 5
-p is used, and the probability is .3 (only this format is valid, i.e. .x where x is a number, others such as 0.2 or 0.3 would be regarded as invalid argument)

At the transmitter side:
